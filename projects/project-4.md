UHStudyNet is a way University of Hawaii at Manoa students can find that perfect student to study with. As you go through college, you will notice that finding other students to study with is a struggle. UHStudyNet clears some of those struggles by bringing an easy way to search and find students like you. When a student is in search of a study buddy, they can create a profile on the website and search through the profiles to find their perfect study habits match. To make things even easier, the search page has a filter that you can use to narrow down your search. Once you see students that seem like a good match, you can add them to your favorite study buddies list. From there you can contact them to set up a study date. After the study session, you are able to report or rate the student you studied with depending on your experience with them. 

One of my roles in the project was designing the My Profile page. I was in charge of creating a mockup for the application to create an image of how we wanted it to look at the end. I designed the entire look of the profile page and what functionalities it would have. One functionality was having a todo list. On the todo list, you can add and remove tasks you need to do for your classes. I implemented the entire todo list. From creating how it looks to adding a new collection in MongoDB server. I designed the entire frontend and backend of the todo list feature. 

During the project, I learned both technical material and time management skills. I became more familiar with Meteor and MongoDb. Creating this web application has certainly opened my eyes to what is put into web development. There's the frontend, which we used Semantic UI to give the application that modern look and the backend which we used Meteor and MongoDB to control the functionalities. All in all, this project has taught me skills that will benefit my future.
