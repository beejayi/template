UI frameworks are as hard to learn as they are complicated, but taking the time to learn them will definitely be worth it in the long run. Using just raw HTML and CSS will not be enough to create that clean, aesthetically pleasing web page that you are looking for. UI frameworks gives you a set of new powerful tools that will assist you in making your vision come to life. Just using HTML and CSS to build a web page is like using a nail and hammer to build a house. It's possible, but it will take a tremendous amount of work. Learning UI frameworks is like getting a new set of power tools and machines to help build the house. Now you can let your imagination can go free.

One example of a useful UI framework is Semantic UI. Semantic removes the need to completely know HTML and CSS by providing simple classes that do most of the work for you. It's syntax mimics natural language as much as possible to make it understandable to almost anyone. There is still a lot of work that comes with learning it, but everything you need to know is on the [Semantic website](https://semantic-ui.com/). The website combines intuitive documentation and clear examples to make learning Semantic go as smoothly as possible. The knowledge gained provides the capability to focus on design rather than syntax.

Personally, learning semantic was stressful and tedious, but definitely worth learning. At first it's a pain constantly looking back at the website for help, but that sense of accomplishment you get when you look at your web page will make everything worth it. Going into this, I had no experience with creating web pages, and now I'm able to create a visually pleasing webpage. This was in a timeframe of about two weeks, so as hard as it may seem, but you won't regret learning it. Now it's time for you to learn it and make work easy with frameworks.
