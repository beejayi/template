Meteor is a powerful framework when it comes to creating functional and imaginative web applications, but it comes with a steep learning curve. The learning curve is caused by the mass amount of information that accompany Meteor. This includes information about syntax, layouts, dependancies and interactions between files. Once these concepts are understood, Meteor lets your creativity go wild by eliminating the common worries that come with building web applications. When building your application with Meteor all you have to do is implement the features and design the user interface. 

Personally I have experienced this learning curve and after working with Meteor for 3 weeks, I feel I have not gotten past it yet. I've been getting comfortable with the format and placement, but the syntax have been the most problematic. It's taking me a while to get use to the interaction between templates, helper functions, event handlers and scripts. Another problem that I've experience with meteor is the attention to detail. Everything in your HTML and JavaScript files have to be perfect, otherwise the application won't display and work correctly. This includes perfect syntax and placement. 

Although Meteor may be confusing and difficult to learn, it's definitely a tool worth having under your belt. It teaches you the basis of building web applications, which sets you up to build larger and more complex websites in the future. The best way to learn it is to keep an open mind and conform to the syntax it uses although your prior knowledge of frameworks says otherwise. Power through the pain and struggle of being hit by a Meteor because the powers you gain will be worth it.
