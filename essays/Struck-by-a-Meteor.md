Meteor is a powerful framework when it comes to creating functional and imaginative web applications, but it comes with a steep learning curve. The learning curve is caused by the mass amount of information that accompany Meteor. This includes information about syntax, layouts, dependancies and interactions between files. Once these concepts are understood, Meteor lets your creativity go wild by eliminating the common worries that come with building web applications. When building your application with Meteor all you have to do is implement the features and design the user interface.
