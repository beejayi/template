Meteor is a great tool, but it does come with a big learning curve. This leads to the first problem that I encountered with it, the massive amount of new concepts and remembering all of them. It was difficult for me to grasp the materials because there were so many. In many of the practice WODs, I found myself watching the screencast first before starting the project on my own. To solve this problem, I continuously look at the code I wrote in previous assignments. Everyday I try to learn something new from Meteor, no matter how small or insignificant it can be to future projects. This has helped me retain most of the syntax and actually understand what my code is doing. I occasionally need help, but it has been getting better. 

The second problem I have encountered with Meteor is that fact that it doesn't work on Windows as well as it works on MACs. My first experience with this was when I did the first big assignment with Meteor. When I tried to invoke the command "meteor run", I would get JavaScript error. This made no sense because I had the same exact code as everyone else. Through the help of our TA and professor, we figured out that Jscript is a non-standard version of JavaScript which cannot run on Windows. Initially to solve this problem, I changed the "let" into "var" in my Javascript file, which solved the problem, but only temporarily. To fix the problem permanently I no run Meteor on Bash instead of the CMD window. 

All in all, Meteor has been a great learning experience and has given me an insight on what goes into web design.
