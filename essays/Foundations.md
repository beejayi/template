When building a house, what do you start with? The walls? The roof? The right answer is the foundation. The foundation is what holds the house together. It's usually the same depending on the overall design of the house. The foundation alone can't be called a house, but it starts the bulding process. There are different types of foundations for different types of houses. For example the structural integrity of a foundation for a mansion is not the same as one for a cottage. The foundation can be thought of as a general solution to a software problem. It serves as a foundation to solve different problems. It's a repeatable solution to a commonly occuring problem in software design.
