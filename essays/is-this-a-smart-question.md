As you go through life, you learn to ask questions, but most of the time, you'll end up with more questions rather than the answer. Then there's the case where there are an enourmous amount of answers, but none fixes your problem specifically. This is the problem that software engineers will always run into as there are infinite possiblities to implementing or solving a problem. When asking smart and insightful questions, you will get a technical and concise answer. Intelligent software engineers are always on the lookout for those good thought-provoking questions and you get their attention by asking questions the right way, the smart way. 

<blockquote>I committed the wrong files into Git. I haven't pushed the commit to the server yet. How can I undo those commits?</blockquote>
  
This is an example of a poorly written question. The first thing I notice is that the person asking the question clearly did not do their reseach before posting the question. This type of problem will most likely be on the GitHub website. Also the quesiton is very vague. This is proven by the answers.
