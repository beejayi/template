I had no prior experience with JavaScript, however I did work with other languages like C and C++. Having programming experience played a great role in learning the language. I feel once you learn how to code, learning new languages just becomes learning new syntax. JavaScript was a whole new feel for me because I'm accustomed to just using C and C++. Also it's my very first scripting language. After completing the tutorials on FreeCodeCamp, I can't wait to learn more about this interesting and powerful language.

As I went through the tutorials, I noticed that JavaScript was easier to learn than I expected. I was nervous about learning a new language because of my experiences learning C and C++. Some JavaScript syntax matched up with these languages perfectly, which also played a big part on why learning it came with ease. For example when creating "for loops" and "while loops". As I compare JavaScript to other languages, I feel it should be one of the first languages that programmers learn. The syntax is easy to follow and on top of that it's so widely used with many applications, especially in website development. I feel that JavaScript is great, but the language that software engineers use, mostly depends on the type of work, comfort and personal preference. For software engineering, JavaScript will always win in website development, but not the preferred language for something like embedded systems.

Another big player to helping me learn Javascript was athletic software engineering. The learning style was great in applying my newly learnt language. Going through tutorials is one thing, but actually applying the language to solve problems is another. The consistent practice through the WODs solidified loose concepts. Also it helps with quick critical thinking while under pressure, which will come in handy during those rigorous software interviews. WODs will definitely help me refine my programming skills and anxiety during stressful quick thinking moments. JavaScript and WODs helped get feet wet on what's to come.
